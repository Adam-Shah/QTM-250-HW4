# QTM 250 HW4

This is a collection of the files used in our QTM 250 Homework #4 project.

For this project, we were interested in elucidating hidden variables that may confound outputs of a Cloud Vision API. Specifically, we wanted to determine if the population size of a country had a relationship with the API's ability to recognize and correctly identify a picture of a notable landmark in that country. 

Please refer to the Colab notebook entitled "HW4.ipynb" for a more detailed description of the project and the code that we used. 

To be able to reproduce the code in this project, you will first need to generate an API key to be able to send requests to the Vision API. To do this:
	- Login to Google Cloud and go to the Navigation menu
	- Select APIs & Services > Credentials
	- Click Create Credentials and select API key
	- Copy the key you just generated and save it as an environment variable in the Cloud Shell
