This is a collection of the files used in our QTM 250 Homework #4 project.

For this project, we were interested in elucidating hidden variables that may confound outputs of a Cloud Vision API. Specifically, we wanted to determine if the population size of a country had a relationship with the API's ability to recognize and correctly identify a picture of a notable landmark in that country. 

Please refer to the Colab notebook entitled "HW4.ipynb" for a more detailed description of the project and our results.
